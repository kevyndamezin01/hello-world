# The round function will automatically round up.

# Using the .floor function this will round the number down.

# By passing the .ceil function this will round the number up.
a = math.ceil(2.1)

# By passing the .pi function this will print out the number of PI
a = math.pi

# By passing the .e function this will give you the number of the expodential
a = math.e
print(a)

# By passing the .sin function this will allow you to work out the trig equation
# Of a number *Note that it will work the equation out in radians not degrees
a = math.sin(math.pi / 2)

# This is how you work out the cos of a function

# This is how you work out the inverse cos of a function
